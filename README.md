# world_data

This repo holds all the information to put realms on the map.

You can use QGIS (version ^3.26) to open and edit `realms_world.qgs`.
This is evidently also the working repo for QGIS.

## build

In order to prepare some files, run: `$ python make.py`
All necessary files will be put in the `build/` folder.

For the ga bags, go to [https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/treppers/genesisproject]() and run:
```
{
  adventurers(first:1000, skip:0) {
    id
    order
  }
}
```

## mapbox

Most of the geojsons are used in the mapbox application.
Contact Pondering Democritus for access tokens if needed.

### tilesets

If you want to upload a bitmap to mapbox, you'll have to create a tileset.
Since the bitmaps are likely going to be over 300MB, you'll have to use the aws cli: [https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/uploads/]()
